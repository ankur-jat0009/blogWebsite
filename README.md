  ### Details
  <p>
### HTML Code:

The HTML code appears to define the structure of a webpage. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. **Header Section (`<header>`)**:
   - Contains elements related to the header of the webpage, such as the navigation bar and search bar toggle button.

2. **Main Content (`<main>`)**:
   - Contains the main content of the webpage, including sections like hero, recent posts, recommended posts, and newsletter.

3. **Footer Section (`<footer>`)**:
   - Contains elements related to the footer of the webpage, such as footer links and copyright information.

### CSS Code:

The CSS code styles the HTML elements to control their appearance and layout. Here are the key aspects addressed in the CSS code:

1. **Custom Properties (CSS Variables)**:
   - Custom properties are defined for colors, typography, spacing, radius, and transitions. These variables allow for easier management and consistency across the stylesheet.

2. **Global Reset**:
   - Resets default styles for various HTML elements using the universal selector (`*`), ensuring consistent styling across different browsers.

3. **Component Styles**:
   - Styles specific components such as buttons, navigation bar, search bar, hero section, recent posts, recommended posts, newsletter, and footer.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Media queries are used to adjust styles based on different screen sizes, ensuring the webpage is visually appealing and functional across various devices.

### JavaScript Code:

The JavaScript code adds interactivity and behavior to the webpage. Here's what each part of the JavaScript code does:

1. **Event Handling Functions**:
   - Defines a reusable function `addEventOnElem` to add event listeners to elements, promoting code reusability.
   - Provides event handling for toggling the navbar and search bar visibility based on user interactions (clicks and checkbox state).

2. **Navbar Toggle Functionality**:
   - Toggles the visibility of the navbar and updates the toggle button's state when clicked or when the checkbox state changes.

3. **Search Bar Toggle Functionality**:
   - Toggles the visibility of the search bar and overlay when the search toggle button is clicked.

Overall, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create a visually appealing and interactive webpage with features like navigation, search, and responsiveness.
